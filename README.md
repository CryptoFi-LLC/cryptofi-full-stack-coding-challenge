# Coding Challenge Readme

Welcome to the CryptoFi Full-Stack Engineering coding challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and "grit". Before you begin, please take a moment to read through this readme to understand the challenge requirements, instructions, and guidelines.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you will be asked to create a simple api endpoint that will allow a user to get a list of crypto prices, along with the user's balances. This part of the coding challenge will require you to get familiar with libraries such as FastApi, Pydantic, and Dyntastic. 
The prices should be ordered by the most amount of holdings a user has, for all the coins that the user holds, then alpabetically.

For the frontend part of the coding challenge, you will be asked to display the cryptocurrencies in order. This part of the coding challenge will require you to get familiar with React and typescript.
We should also be able to switch between the 2 users available. This can be done with a dropdown or a button. We expect to see the use of [context](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) for this part of the challenge.

### Requirements

- A GET route that returns ordered prices and balances 
  - For example - I pass in User `1`, I will receive the user's balances for User `1`
- List out all prices and balances on the frontend
  - Coins should be ordered by the most amount of holdings a user has, for all the coins that the user holds, then alpabetically.
- List out the 2 users available and be able to switch back and forth between them
  - This can be done with a dropdown or a button
  - The balances shown should update when switching between users


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the challenge:

1. **Fork**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
1. **Clone**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
1. **Local Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. For Mac users, the easiest way to do this is by downloading [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Ensure `Make` is installed on your computer. For Mac Users this should already be pre installed
1. **Commands**
   - **Note:** these commands should be run in a terminal window from the root of the project.
   - `make run` - start api
   - `make stop` - stops api and removes database
   - `make bash` - opens terminal window inside running api docker container. This is useful for running the test suite directly from the running container vs using `make run-testsuite`. This is an advanced command.
   - `make destroy` - cleans all unused docker containers from your machine. This should only be used too free up memory post code challenge completion.
1. **Whats Provided**
   - A Dockerized API which will run on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Autogenerated api docs for testing [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - A React Frontend which will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - A Local DynamoDb Gui for viewing data in the database [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/)

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your solution, follow these steps:

1. **Commit Changes**: Make sure to commit your code changes locally.
1. **Push to GitHub**: Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. **Invite Us**: Invite @alexanderlukens, @cooncesean, and @RamseyV to review the repo
1. **Loom Video**: Create a short [loom video](https://www.loom.com/) (5 minutes or less) describing your approach and demoing the coding challenge. 
1. **Email**: Once complete, please reach out to [Becca](mailto:becca@cryptofi.tech) our HR representive with the loom video attached and we will be in touch!

In your pull request, include the following:

- A brief description of the approach you took to solve the challenge.
- Any relevant notes, assumptions, or trade-offs you made during the development process.
